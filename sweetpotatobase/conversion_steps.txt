run from /sweetpotatobase/converter/src directory:

`java -cp ../lib/*:.  bioversity/mal/TdV5ToOboSP ../../TD_CO_331_Sweet_Potato_EN2.xlsx ../../sp.obo`

where `TD_CO_331_Sweet_Potato_EN2.xlsx` is the triat dictionary file to convert, and `../../sp.obo` is the obo file to create

If changes need to be made to the sweetpotatobase/converter/src/bioversity/mal/TdV5ToOboSP.java conversion script, it must be recompiled afterwards by running
`javac -cp ../lib/*:.  bioversity/mal/TdV5ToOboSP`

if javac isn't installed, install it with `sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre`
